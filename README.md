# Defarm-OI
Orgonic Intelligence Defarm Exo-cortex, a collaborative resource log

This markdown document is for the concentration of helpful videos, articles and formulas that serve to educate defarm participants on how to effectively establish their operation and enliven their crops.

At the moment this document is public but only known to the plantsinside defarm groupchat.

There are also topics which are of great interest to our group that have not been covered in depth. I will include a rough sketch of the unexplored topics.

As a defarmer, feel free to add a resource that has helped you understand something in the past in the general section. You can also tackle the unexplored topics below that. Please insert your submissions in such a way that they are pleasant to look at and informative.

#WANTED WANTED BOUNTY INFO WANTED DEAD OR ALIVE

The mission of defarm is to consolidate all independent gardeners and growers into a network of experimental feedback iteration that will drive vertical farm efficiency to the optimized limit.

#Data market
In order to encourage adoption, there must be a gain for the defarmer to participate. I believe we can create a grow data market that compensates defarmers for their contribution. The infrastructure that makes this possible today is ocean protocol.

The task at hand is to march toward the critical mass moment when our defarmer nodes become a data harvesting operation that rivals the research and development branches of vertical farming corporations. In order to get there, we need to make our data as tantalizing as possible to them. So the question is:

1. How does a defarm user organize their plant growth data in a standardized format that vertical farms already use or could feasibly accomodate?

Assuming the most basic grow sense apparatus contains: Light lux, Air temp/humidity, Water temp/pH/EC and a webcam, what are the sensing intervals that create a complete picture of what's happening in the grow without being too bloated? (i.e. all measurements every second)

I like 200s intervals since there are 432 of these in a day.

#AI
The point of the datamarket is to feed machine learning algorithms that are training to understand plant growth. Before the defarm reaches the critical mass of grow data and user activity, I propose that grant money be used to train an in-house algorithm with the intention of developing a general agricultural AI.

2. How do you train a general agriculture AI?

#hackathon
Not everyone can afford a fully equipped, standard issue experimental defarm node device. But there are other simpler grow apparatuses that can integrate into the defarm through data collection. We need a MVP defarm node that consists of a water proof raspberry pi, webcam, light sensor and humidity sensor.
